The final project in CPSC 529: Introduction to Human Computer Interaction (Spring 2019). Me and 3 others in the class worked together to design a phone app, called Forage, that can help to minimize food waste, especially for those who live by themselves and tend to have lots of leftover ingredients. Forage helps people create and find gatherings near them to cook delicious meals. It recommends food recipes based on ingredients people may already have while taking into account dietary restrictions and automatically calculates the amount of food needed to minimize food waste. Our project involved lots of initial brainstorming, then contextual inquiries with graduate students who cook for themselves, sketches of potential solutions, low-fidelity prototypes, and a final high-fidelity prototype after user testing.
